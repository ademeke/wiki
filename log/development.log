The remaining data is available through PuppetDB’s query APIs (see navigation sidebar for details).\r\n\r\n 70  sudo puppet resource package puppetdb ensure=2.3.8-1.el7\r\n   71  vi /etc/sysconfig/puppetdb\r\n   73  sudo puppet resource service puppetdb ensure=running enable=true\r\n   74  puppet agent -tv\r\n   77  service puppetdb status\r\n   79  sudo puppet node status\r\n   open port 8081 and 8080\r\n=========\r\nrpm -ivh https://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-el-6.noarch.rpm\r\n[root@pt-wo-puppet2 ~]#  puppet resource package puppetdb-terminus ensure=latest\r\nWarning: Setting manifest is deprecated in puppet.conf.

As the default value is defined in params.pp,\r\nthe main apache class has to inherit it, as shown in the following code:\r\n\r\nclass apache (\r\n  $package_name = $apache::params::package_name,\r\n  ) inherits apache::params {\r\n    package { $apache::params::package_name:\r\n      ensure => present,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nThe params pattern has been widely used, and it works well. Still, it mixes code and data, even if this is done only in a dedicated subclass.\r\n====================\r\n\r\nclass postgresql […] { […]\r\nclass{'postgresql::install': } ->\r\nclass{'postgresql::config': } ~>\r\nclass{'postgresql::service': }\r\n}\r\n\r\nChaining Arrows\r\n\r\n    # ntp.conf is applied first, and will notify the ntpd service if it changes:\r\n    File['/etc/ntp.conf'] ~> Service['ntpd']\r\n\r\nAnchor Pattern\r\n-----\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.mayflower.de/4573-The-Puppet-Anchor-Pattern-in-Practice.html\r\nPuppet extends this dependency to the resources declared in that class, as we may expect, but not to other classes eventually\r\ndeclared (included) there.\r\n\r\nThis may create problems and lead to unexpected behaviors (dependencies not managed in the order expected) when referring to a \r\nclass such as postgresql, which we have seen, where the main class includes other subclasses.\r\nA widely used workaround is the anchor pattern defined by Puppet Lab's Jeff\r\nMcCune. It is based on the anchor type included in Puppet Labs' stdlib module.\r\nThe anchor type can be declared as a normal resource in the following way:\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::start': }\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::end': }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::start': } ->\r\nclass{'postgresql::install': } ->\r\nclass{'postgresql::config': } ~>\r\nclass{'postgresql::service': } ->\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::end': }\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this way, we can create a relationship that involves a whole class with a chaining\r\narrow as follows:\r\n\r\nclass { 'postgresql': } -> class { 'wordpress': }\r\nBy doing so, we are sure that all the resources provided in the postgresql class\r\nare applied before the wordpress class' declarations, because they are explicitly\r\ncontained in the anchor resource type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=============================\r\nDefined resource types (also called defined types or defines) are blocks of Puppet code that can be evaluated multiple times with different parameters. Once defined, they act like a new resource type: you can cause the block to be evaluated by declaring a resource of that new resource type.\r\n\r\nDefines can be used as simple macros or as a lightweight way to develop fairly sophisticated resource types.\r\n\r\nSyntax\r\nDefining a Type\r\n\r\nYou can use a define statement to create a new defined resource type.\r\n\r\n# /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/apache/manifests/vhost.pp\r\n\r\ndefine apache::vhost (\r\n  Integer $port,\r\n  String[1] $docroot,\r\n  String[1] $servername = $title,\r\n  String $vhost_name = '*'\r\n  ) {\r\n  include apache \t\t\t\t\t\t\t# contains Package['httpd'] and Service['httpd']\r\n  include apache::params \t\t\t\t\t# contains common config settings\r\n  $vhost_dir = $apache::params::vhost_dir\r\n  file { \"${vhost_dir}/${servername}.conf\":\r\n    content => template('apache/vhost-default.conf.erb'),\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t# This template can access all of the parameters and variables from above.\r\n    owner   => 'www',\r\n    group   => 'www',\r\n    mode    => '644',\r\n    require => Package['httpd'],\r\n    notify  => Service['httpd'],\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis creates a new resource type called apache::vhost.\r\n\r\nThe general form of a define statement is:\r\n\r\n\t\tThe define keyword\r\n\t\tThe name of the defined type\r\n\t\tAn optional parameter list, which consists of:\r\n\t\tAn opening parenthesis\r\n\t\tA comma-separated list of parameters (e.g. String $myparam = \"default value\"). Each parameter consists of:\r\n\t\tAn optional data type, which will restrict the allowed values for the parameter (defaults to Any)\r\n\t\tA variable name to represent the parameter, including the $ prefix\r\n\t\tAn optional equals (=) sign and default value (which must match the data type, if one was specified)\r\n\t\tAn optional trailing comma after the last parameter\r\n\t\tA closing parenthesis\r\n\t\tAn opening curly brace\r\n\t\tA block of arbitrary Puppet code, which generally contains at least one resource declaration\r\n\t\tA closing curly brace\r\n\t\tThe definition does not cause the code in the block to be added to the catalog; it only makes it available. To execute the code, you must declare one or more resources of the defined type.\r\n\r\nDeclaring an Instance\r\n\r\nInstances of a defined type (often just called “resources”) can be declared the same way a normal resource is declared.\r\n(That is, with a resource type, title, and set of attribute/value pairs.)\r\n\r\nThe parameters used when defining the type become the attributes (without the $ prefix) used when declaring resources of that type.\r\nParameters which have a default value are optional; if they are left out of the declaration, the default will be used. \r\nParameters without defaults must be specified.\r\n\r\nTo declare a resource of the apache::vhost defined type from the example above:\r\n\r\napache::vhost {'homepages':\r\n  port    => 8081,\r\n  docroot => '/var/www-testhost',\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n$title and $name\r\nEvery defined type gets two “free” parameters, which are always available and do not have to be explicitly added to the definition:\r\n\r\n$title is always set to the title of the instance. Since it is guaranteed to be unique for each instance, it is useful when making sure that \r\n     contained resources are unique. (See “Resource Uniqueness” below.)\r\n$name defaults to the value of $title, but users can optionally specify a different value when they declare an instance. \r\n     This is only useful for mimicking the behavior of a resource with a namevar, which is usually unnecessary. If you are wondering whether to use $name or $title, use $title.\r\n\t\r\nUnlike the other parameters, the values of $title and $name are already available inside the parameter list. This means you can use $title as the default value (or part of the default value) for another attribute:\r\n=========================================\r\nbefore\r\n\tCauses a resource to be applied before the target resource.\r\nrequire\r\n\tCauses a resource to be applied after the target resource.\r\nnotify\r\n\tCauses a resource to be applied before the target resource. The target resource will refresh if the notifying resource changes.\r\nsubscribe\r\n\tCauses a resource to be applied after the target resource. The subscribing resource will refresh if the target resource changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf two resources need to happen in order, you can either put a before attribute in the prior one or a require attribute in the subsequent one; either approach will create the same relationship. The same is true of notify and subscribe.\r\n\r\nThe two examples below create the same ordering relationship:\r\n\r\n    package { 'openssh-server':\r\n      ensure => present,\r\n      before => File['/etc/ssh/sshd_config'],\r\n    }\r\n     file { '/etc/ssh/sshd_config':\r\n      ensure  => file,\r\n      mode    => 600,\r\n      source  => 'puppet:///modules/sshd/sshd_config',\r\n      require => Package['openssh-server'],\r\n    }\r\nThe two examples below create the same notification relationship:\r\n\r\n    file { '/etc/ssh/sshd_config':\r\n      ensure => file,\r\n      mode   => 600,\r\n      source => 'puppet:///modules/sshd/sshd_config',\r\n      notify => Service['sshd'],\r\n    }\r\n     service { 'sshd':\r\n      ensure    => running,\r\n      enable    => true,\r\n      subscribe => File['/etc/ssh/sshd_config'],\r\n    }\r\nChaining Arrows\r\n\r\n    # ntp.conf is applied first, and will notify the ntpd service if it changes:\r\n    File['/etc/ntp.conf'] ~> Service['ntpd']\r\nYou can create relationships between two resources or groups of resources using the -> and ~> operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n-> (ordering arrow)\r\nCauses the resource on the left to be applied before the resource on the right.

Each parameter consists of:\r\nAn optional data type, which will restrict the allowed values for the parameter (defaults to Any)\r\nA variable name to represent the parameter, including the $ prefix\r\nAn optional equals (=) sign and default value (which must match the data type, if one was specified)\r\nAn optional trailing comma after the last parameter\r\nA closing parenthesis\r\nAn opening curly brace\r\nA block of arbitrary Puppet code, which generally contains at least one resource declaration\r\nA closing curly brace\r\nThe definition does not cause the code in the block to be added to the catalog; it only makes it available. To execute the code, you must declare one or more resources of the defined type.\r\n\r\nDeclaring an Instance\r\n\r\nInstances of a defined type (often just called “resources”) can be declared the same way a normal resource is declared. (That is, with a resource type, title, and set of attribute/value pairs.)\r\n\r\nThe parameters used when defining the type become the attributes (without the $ prefix) used when declaring resources of that type. Parameters which have a default value are optional; if they are left out of the declaration, the default will be used. Parameters without defaults must be specified.\r\n\r\nTo declare a resource of the apache::vhost defined type from the example above:\r\n\r\napache::vhost {'homepages':\r\n  port    => 8081,\r\n  docroot => '/var/www-testhost',\r\n}\r\nBehavior\r\nIf a defined type is present and loadable (see “Location” below), you can declare resources of that defined type anywhere in your manifests.\r\n\r\nDeclaring a new resource of the defined type will make Puppet re-evaluate the block of code in the definition, using different values for the parameters.\r\n\r\nParameters and Attributes\r\n\r\nEvery parameter of a defined type can be used as a local variable inside the definition. These variables are not set with normal assignment statements; instead, each instance of the defined type uses its attributes to set them:\r\n\r\napache::vhost {'homepages':\r\n  port    => 8081, # Becomes the value of $port\r\n  docroot => '/var/www-testhost', # Becomes the value of $docroot\r\n}\r\nIn the define statement that creates the defined type, each parameter can be preceeded by an optional data type. If you include one, Puppet will check the parameter’s value at runtime to make sure that it has the right data type, and raise an error if the value is illegal. If no data type is provided, the parameter will accept values of any data type.\r\n\r\nNote that the special variables $title and $name are both set to the defined type’s name automatically, so they can’t be used as parameters.\r\n\r\n$title and $name\r\n\r\nEvery defined type gets two “free” parameters, which are always available and do not have to be explicitly added to the definition:\r\n\r\n$title is always set to the title of the instance. Since it is guaranteed to be unique for each instance, it is useful when making sure that contained resources are unique. (See “Resource Uniqueness” below.)\r\n$name defaults to the value of $title, but users can optionally specify a different value when they declare an instance. This is only useful for mimicking the behavior of a resource with a namevar, which is usually unnecessary. If you are wondering whether to use $name or $title, use $title.\r\nUnlike the other parameters, the values of $title and $name are already available inside the parameter list. This means you can use $title as the default value (or part of the default value) for another attribute:\r\n\r\ndefine apache::vhost (Integer $port, String[1] $docroot, String $servername = $title, Str\r\n\r\n\r\n=================Regex match Ops\r\n\r\n  if $host =~ /^www(\\d+)\\./ {\r\n      notify { \"Welcome web server \#$1\": }\r\n    }\r\n\t\r\nWindows7FTDMid | 6GB RAM | 2 VCPU | 53GB Disk\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\ndevelopment \r\n\r\n  git checkout PT\r\n  947  it pull\r\n  948  git pull\r\n  949  vi Puppetfile\r\n  950  git add Puppetfile\r\n  951  git commit -m \"jboss,psb_utils,tomcat_wrapper,script_server,solr: PSB v17\"\r\n  952  git push origin PT\r\n  \r\n  953  git checkout DEV\r\n  954  git branch -a\r\n  955  vi Puppetfile\r\n  956  git diff\r\n  957  git add Puppetfile\r\n  958  git diff\r\n  959  git commit -m \"jboss,psb_utils,tomcat_wrapper,script_server,solr: PSB v17\"\r\n  960  git push origin DEV\r\n  \r\n  961  git checkout SIT\r\n  962  git branch -v\r\n  963  vi Puppetfile\r\n  964  git diff\r\n  965  git add Puppetfile\r\n  966  git commit -m \"jboss,psb_utils,tomcat_wrapper,script_server,solr: PSB v17\"\r\n  967  git branch -v\r\n  968  git push origin SIT\r\n  \r\n  969  git checkout FQT\r\n  970  vi Puppetfile\r\n  971  git diff\r\n  972  git add p\r\n  973  git add Puppetfile\r\n  974  git commit -m \"jboss,psb_utils,tomcat_wrapper,script_server,solr: PSB v17\"\r\n  975  git push origin FQT\r\n  976  git branch -v\r\n\r\nPVT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, "commit"=>"Create Article"}

As the default value is defined in params.pp,\r\nthe main apache class has to inherit it, as shown in the following code:\r\n\r\nclass apache (\r\n  $package_name = $apache::params::package_name,\r\n  ) inherits apache::params {\r\n    package { $apache::params::package_name:\r\n      ensure => present,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nThe params pattern has been widely used, and it works well. Still, it mixes code and data, even if this is done only in a dedicated subclass.\r\n====================\r\n\r\nclass postgresql […] { […]\r\nclass{'postgresql::install': } ->\r\nclass{'postgresql::config': } ~>\r\nclass{'postgresql::service': }\r\n}\r\n\r\nChaining Arrows\r\n\r\n    # ntp.conf is applied first, and will notify the ntpd service if it changes:\r\n    File['/etc/ntp.conf'] ~> Service['ntpd']\r\n\r\nAnchor Pattern\r\n-----\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.mayflower.de/4573-The-Puppet-Anchor-Pattern-in-Practice.html\r\nPuppet extends this dependency to the resources declared in that class, as we may expect, but not to other classes eventually\r\ndeclared (included) there.\r\n\r\nThis may create problems and lead to unexpected behaviors (dependencies not managed in the order expected) when referring to a \r\nclass such as postgresql, which we have seen, where the main class includes other subclasses.\r\nA widely used workaround is the anchor pattern defined by Puppet Lab's Jeff\r\nMcCune. It is based on the anchor type included in Puppet Labs' stdlib module.\r\nThe anchor type can be declared as a normal resource in the following way:\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::start': }\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::end': }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::start': } ->\r\nclass{'postgresql::install': } ->\r\nclass{'postgresql::config': } ~>\r\nclass{'postgresql::service': } ->\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::end': }\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this way, we can create a relationship that involves a whole class with a chaining\r\narrow as follows:\r\n\r\nclass { 'postgresql': } -> class { 'wordpress': }\r\nBy doing so, we are sure that all the resources provided in the postgresql class\r\nare applied before the wordpress class' declarations, because they are explicitly\r\ncontained in the anchor resource type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=============================\r\nDefined resource types (also called defined types or defines) are blocks of Puppet code that can be evaluated multiple times with different parameters. Once defined, they act like a new resource type: you can cause the block to be evaluated by declaring a resource of that new resource type.\r\n\r\nDefines can be used as simple macros or as a lightweight way to develop fairly sophisticated resource types.\r\n\r\nSyntax\r\nDefining a Type\r\n\r\nYou can use a define statement to create a new defined resource type.\r\n\r\n# /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/apache/manifests/vhost.pp\r\n\r\ndefine apache::vhost (\r\n  Integer $port,\r\n  String[1] $docroot,\r\n  String[1] $servername = $title,\r\n  String $vhost_name = '*'\r\n  ) {\r\n  include apache \t\t\t\t\t\t\t# contains Package['httpd'] and Service['httpd']\r\n  include apache::params \t\t\t\t\t# contains common config settings\r\n  $vhost_dir = $apache::params::vhost_dir\r\n  file { \"${vhost_dir}/${servername}.conf\":\r\n    content => template('apache/vhost-default.conf.erb'),\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t# This template can access all of the parameters and variables from above.\r\n    owner   => 'www',\r\n    group   => 'www',\r\n    mode    => '644',\r\n    require => Package['httpd'],\r\n    notify  => Service['httpd'],\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis creates a new resource type called apache::vhost.\r\n\r\nThe general form of a define statement is:\r\n\r\n\t\tThe define keyword\r\n\t\tThe name of the defined type\r\n\t\tAn optional parameter list, which consists of:\r\n\t\tAn opening parenthesis\r\n\t\tA comma-separated list of parameters (e.g. String $myparam = \"default value\").

To chain multiple resources at once, you must use a multi-resource reference or a collector.\r\nAn operand can be shared between two chaining statements, which allows you to link them together into a “timeline:”\r\n\r\n    Package['ntp'] -> File['/etc/ntp.conf'] ~> Service['ntpd']\r\n\t\r\n\tSince resource declarations can be chained, you can use chaining arrows to make Puppet apply a section of code in the order that it is written:\r\n\r\n    # first:\r\n    package { 'openssh-server':\r\n      ensure => present,\r\n    } -> # and then:\r\n    file { '/etc/ssh/sshd_config':\r\n      ensure => file,\r\n      mode   => 600,\r\n      source => 'puppet:///modules/sshd/sshd_config',\r\n    } ~> # and then:\r\n    service { 'sshd':\r\n      ensure => running,\r\n      enable => true,\r\n    }\r\n\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe require function declares a class and causes it to become a dependency of the surrounding container:\r\n\r\n    class wordpress {\r\n      require apache\r\n      require mysql\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\nThe above example would cause every resource in the apache and mysql classes to be applied before any of the resources in the wordpress class.\r\n\r\nUnlike the relationship metaparameters and chaining arrows, the require function does not have a reciprocal form or a notifying form. \r\nHowever, more complex behavior can be obtained by combining include and chaining arrows inside a class definition:\r\n\r\n    class apache::ssl {\r\n      include site::certificates\r\n      # Restart every service in this class if any of our SSL certificates change on disk:\r\n      Class['site::certificates'] ~> Class['apache::ssl']\r\n    }\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\nDefined resource types (also called defined types or defines) are blocks of Puppet code that can be evaluated multiple times with different parameters. \r\nOnce defined, they act like a new resource type: you can cause the block to be evaluated by declaring a resource of that new resource type.\r\n\r\nDefines can be used as simple macros or as a lightweight way to develop fairly sophisticated resource types.\r\n\r\nSyntax \r\n-------------\r\nDefining a Type\r\nYou can use a define statement to create a new defined resource type.\r\n\r\n# /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/apache/manifests/vhost.pp\r\n\r\ndefine apache::vhost (Integer $port, String[1] $docroot, String[1] $servername = $title, String $vhost_name = '*') {\r\n  include apache \t\t\t\t\t\t\t# contains Package['httpd'] and Service['httpd']\r\n  include apache::params \t\t\t\t\t# contains common config settings\r\n  $vhost_dir = $apache::params::vhost_dir\r\n  \r\n  file { \"${vhost_dir}/${servername}.conf\":\r\n    content => template('apache/vhost-default.conf.erb'),\r\n      # This template can access all of the parameters and variables from above.\r\n    owner   => 'www',\r\n    group   => 'www',\r\n\t\r\n    mode    => '644',\r\n    require => Package['httpd'],\r\n    notify  => Service['httpd'],\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n----  just a params example\r\n\t\t\t\t\t# /etc/puppet/modules/webserver/manifests/params.pp\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tclass webserver::params {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  $packages = $operatingsystem ? {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/(?i-mx:ubuntu|debian)/        => 'apache2',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/(?i-mx:centos|fedora|redhat)/ => 'httpd',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  }\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  $vhost_dir = $operatingsystem ? {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/(?i-mx:ubuntu|debian)/        => '/etc/apache2/sites-enabled',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/(?i-mx:centos|fedora|redhat)/ => '/etc/httpd/conf.d',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  }\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t# /etc/puppet/modules/webserver/manifests/init.pp\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tclass webserver(\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  String $packages  = $webserver::params::packages,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  String $vhost_dir = $webserver::params::vhost_dir\r\n\t\t\t\t\t) inherits webserver::params {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t package { $packages: ensure => present }\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t file { 'vhost_dir':\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   path   => $vhost_dir,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   ensure => directory,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   mode   => '0750',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   owner  => 'www-data',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   group  => 'root',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t }\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n----\r\nThis creates a new resource type called apache::vhost.\r\n\r\nThe general form of a define statement is:\r\n\r\nThe define keyword\r\nThe name of the defined type\r\nAn optional parameter list, which consists of:\r\nAn opening parenthesis\r\nA comma-separated list of parameters (e.g. String $myparam = \"default value\"). Each parameter consists of:\r\nAn optional data type, which will restrict the allowed values for the parameter (defaults to Any)\r\nA variable name to represent the parameter, including the $ prefix\r\nAn optional equals (=) sign and default value (which must match the data type, if one was specified)\r\nAn optional trailing comma after the last parameter\r\nA closing parenthesis\r\nAn opening curly brace\r\nA block of arbitrary Puppet code, which generally contains at least one resource declaration\r\nA closing curly brace\r\nThe definition does not cause the code in the block to be added to the catalog; it only makes it available. To execute the code, you must declare one or more resources of the defined type.\r\n\r\nDeclaring an Instance\r\n\r\nInstances of a defined type (often just called “resources”) can be declared the same way a normal resource is declared. (That is, with a resource type, title, and set of attribute/value pairs.)\r\n\r\nThe parameters used when defining the type become the attributes (without the $ prefix) used when declaring resources of that type. Parameters which have a default value are optional; if they are left out of the declaration, the default will be used. Parameters without defaults must be specified.\r\n\r\nTo declare a resource of the apache::vhost defined type from the example above:\r\n\r\napache::vhost {'homepages':\r\n  port    => 8081,\r\n  docroot => '/var/www-testhost',\r\n}\r\nBehavior\r\nIf a defined type is present and loadable (see “Location” below), you can declare resources of that defined type anywhere in your manifests.\r\n\r\nDeclaring a new resource of the defined type will make Puppet re-evaluate the block of code in the definition, using different values for the parameters.\r\n\r\nParameters and Attributes\r\n\r\nEvery parameter of a defined type can be used as a local variable inside the definition. These variables are not set with normal assignment statements; instead, each instance of the defined type uses its attributes to set them:\r\n\r\napache::vhost {'homepages':\r\n  port    => 8081, # Becomes the value of $port\r\n  docroot => '/var/www-testhost', # Becomes the value of $docroot\r\n}\r\nIn the define statement that creates the defined type, each parameter can be preceeded by an optional data type. If you include one, Puppet will check the parameter’s value at runtime to make sure that it has the right data type, and raise an error if the value is illegal. If no data type is provided, the parameter will accept values of any data type.\r\n\r\nNote that the special variables $title and $name are both set to the defined type’s name automatically, so they can’t be used as parameters.\r\n\r\n$title and $name\r\n\r\nEvery defined type gets two “free” parameters, which are always available and do not have to be explicitly added to the definition:\r\n\r\n$title is always set to the title of the instance. Since it is guaranteed to be unique for each instance, it is useful when making sure that contained resources are unique. (See “Resource Uniqueness” below.)\r\n$name defaults to the value of $title, but users can optionally specify a different value when they declare an instance. This is only useful for mimicking the behavior of a resource with a namevar, which is usually unnecessary. If you are wondering whether to use $name or $title, use $title.\r\nUnlike the other parameters, the values of $title and $name are already available inside the parameter list. This means you can use $title as the default value (or part of the default value) for another attribute:\r\n\r\ndefine apache::vhost (Integer $port, String[1] $docroot, String $servername = $title, Str\r\n\r\n\r\n=================Regex match Ops\r\n\r\n  if $host =~ /^www(\\d+)\\./ {\r\n      notify { \"Welcome web server \#$1\": }\r\n    }\r\n\t\r\nWindows7FTDMid | 6GB RAM | 2 VCPU | 53GB Disk\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\ndevelopment \r\n\r\n  git checkout PT\r\n  947  it pull\r\n  948  git pull\r\n  949  vi Puppetfile\r\n  950  git add Puppetfile\r\n  951  git commit -m \"jboss,psb_utils,tomcat_wrapper,script_server,solr: PSB v17\"\r\n  952  git push origin PT\r\n  \r\n  953  git checkout DEV\r\n  954  git branch -a\r\n  955  vi Puppetfile\r\n  956  git diff\r\n  957  git add Puppetfile\r\n  958  git diff\r\n  959  git commit -m \"jboss,psb_utils,tomcat_wrapper,script_server,solr: PSB v17\"\r\n  960  git push origin DEV\r\n  \r\n  961  git checkout SIT\r\n  962  git branch -v\r\n  963  vi Puppetfile\r\n  964  git diff\r\n  965  git add Puppetfile\r\n  966  git commit -m \"jboss,psb_utils,tomcat_wrapper,script_server,solr: PSB v17\"\r\n  967  git branch -v\r\n  968  git push origin SIT\r\n  \r\n  969  git checkout FQT\r\n  970  vi Puppetfile\r\n  971  git diff\r\n  972  git add p\r\n  973  git add Puppetfile\r\n  974  git commit -m \"jboss,psb_utils,tomcat_wrapper,script_server,solr: PSB v17\"\r\n  975  git push origin FQT\r\n  976  git branch -v\r\n\r\nPVT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"], ["created_at", 2017-02-27 14:15:35 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-27 14:15:35 UTC], ["user_id", 1], ["category_id", 2]]

As the default value is defined in params.pp,\r\nthe main apache class has to inherit it, as shown in the following code:\r\n\r\nclass apache (\r\n  $package_name = $apache::params::package_name,\r\n  ) inherits apache::params {\r\n    package { $apache::params::package_name:\r\n      ensure => present,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nThe params pattern has been widely used, and it works well. Still, it mixes code and data, even if this is done only in a dedicated subclass.\r\n====================\r\n\r\nclass postgresql […] { […]\r\nclass{'postgresql::install': } ->\r\nclass{'postgresql::config': } ~>\r\nclass{'postgresql::service': }\r\n}\r\n\r\nChaining Arrows\r\n\r\n    # ntp.conf is applied first, and will notify the ntpd service if it changes:\r\n    File['/etc/ntp.conf'] ~> Service['ntpd']\r\n\r\nAnchor Pattern\r\n-----\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.mayflower.de/4573-The-Puppet-Anchor-Pattern-in-Practice.html\r\nPuppet extends this dependency to the resources declared in that class, as we may expect, but not to other classes eventually\r\ndeclared (included) there.\r\n\r\nThis may create problems and lead to unexpected behaviors (dependencies not managed in the order expected) when referring to a \r\nclass such as postgresql, which we have seen, where the main class includes other subclasses.\r\nA widely used workaround is the anchor pattern defined by Puppet Lab's Jeff\r\nMcCune. It is based on the anchor type included in Puppet Labs' stdlib module.\r\nThe anchor type can be declared as a normal resource in the following way:\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::start': }\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::end': }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::start': } ->\r\nclass{'postgresql::install': } ->\r\nclass{'postgresql::config': } ~>\r\nclass{'postgresql::service': } ->\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::end': }\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this way, we can create a relationship that involves a whole class with a chaining\r\narrow as follows:\r\n\r\nclass { 'postgresql': } -> class { 'wordpress': }\r\nBy doing so, we are sure that all the resources provided in the postgresql class\r\nare applied before the wordpress class' declarations, because they are explicitly\r\ncontained in the anchor resource type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=============================\r\nDefined resource types (also called defined types or defines) are blocks of Puppet code that can be evaluated multiple times with different parameters. Once defined, they act like a new resource type: you can cause the block to be evaluated by declaring a resource of that new resource type.\r\n\r\nDefines can be used as simple macros or as a lightweight way to develop fairly sophisticated resource types.\r\n\r\nSyntax\r\nDefining a Type\r\n\r\nYou can use a define statement to create a new defined resource type.\r\n\r\n# /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/apache/manifests/vhost.pp\r\n\r\ndefine apache::vhost (\r\n  Integer $port,\r\n  String[1] $docroot,\r\n  String[1] $servername = $title,\r\n  String $vhost_name = '*'\r\n  ) {\r\n  include apache \t\t\t\t\t\t\t# contains Package['httpd'] and Service['httpd']\r\n  include apache::params \t\t\t\t\t# contains common config settings\r\n  $vhost_dir = $apache::params::vhost_dir\r\n  file { \"${vhost_dir}/${servername}.conf\":\r\n    content => template('apache/vhost-default.conf.erb'),\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t# This template can access all of the parameters and variables from above.\r\n    owner   => 'www',\r\n    group   => 'www',\r\n    mode    => '644',\r\n    require => Package['httpd'],\r\n    notify  => Service['httpd'],\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis creates a new resource type called apache::vhost.\r\n\r\nThe general form of a define statement is:\r\n\r\n\t\tThe define keyword\r\n\t\tThe name of the defined type\r\n\t\tAn optional parameter list, which consists of:\r\n\t\tAn opening parenthesis\r\n\t\tA comma-separated list of parameters (e.g. String $myparam = \"default value\"). Each parameter consists of:\r\n\t\tAn optional data type, which will restrict the allowed values for the parameter (defaults to Any)\r\n\t\tA variable name to represent the parameter, including the $ prefix\r\n\t\tAn optional equals (=) sign and default value (which must match the data type, if one was specified)\r\n\t\tAn optional trailing comma after the last parameter\r\n\t\tA closing parenthesis\r\n\t\tAn opening curly brace\r\n\t\tA block of arbitrary Puppet code, which generally contains at least one resource declaration\r\n\t\tA closing curly brace\r\n\t\tThe definition does not cause the code in the block to be added to the catalog; it only makes it available. To execute the code, you must declare one or more resources of the defined type.\r\n\r\nDeclaring an Instance\r\n\r\nInstances of a defined type (often just called “resources”) can be declared the same way a normal resource is declared.\r\n(That is, with a resource type, title, and set of attribute/value pairs.)\r\n\r\nThe parameters used when defining the type become the attributes (without the $ prefix) used when declaring resources of that type.\r\nParameters which have a default value are optional; if they are left out of the declaration, the default will be used. \r\nParameters without defaults must be specified.\r\n\r\nTo declare a resource of the apache::vhost defined type from the example above:\r\n\r\napache::vhost {'homepages':\r\n  port    => 8081,\r\n  docroot => '/var/www-testhost',\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n$title and $name\r\nEvery defined type gets two “free” parameters, which are always available and do not have to be explicitly added to the definition:\r\n\r\n$title is always set to the title of the instance. Since it is guaranteed to be unique for each instance, it is useful when making sure that \r\n     contained resources are unique. (See “Resource Uniqueness” below.)\r\n$name defaults to the value of $title, but users can optionally specify a different value when they declare an instance. \r\n     This is only useful for mimicking the behavior of a resource with a namevar, which is usually unnecessary. If you are wondering whether to use $name or $title, use $title.\r\n\t\r\nUnlike the other parameters, the values of $title and $name are already available inside the parameter list. This means you can use $title as the default value (or part of the default value) for another attribute:\r\n=========================================\r\nbefore\r\n\tCauses a resource to be applied before the target resource.\r\nrequire\r\n\tCauses a resource to be applied after the target resource.\r\nnotify\r\n\tCauses a resource to be applied before the target resource. The target resource will refresh if the notifying resource changes.\r\nsubscribe\r\n\tCauses a resource to be applied after the target resource. The subscribing resource will refresh if the target resource changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf two resources need to happen in order, you can either put a before attribute in the prior one or a require attribute in the subsequent one; either approach will create the same relationship. The same is true of notify and subscribe.\r\n\r\nThe two examples below create the same ordering relationship:\r\n\r\n    package { 'openssh-server':\r\n      ensure => present,\r\n      before => File['/etc/ssh/sshd_config'],\r\n    }\r\n     file { '/etc/ssh/sshd_config':\r\n      ensure  => file,\r\n      mode    => 600,\r\n      source  => 'puppet:///modules/sshd/sshd_config',\r\n      require => Package['openssh-server'],\r\n    }\r\nThe two examples below create the same notification relationship:\r\n\r\n    file { '/etc/ssh/sshd_config':\r\n      ensure => file,\r\n      mode   => 600,\r\n      source => 'puppet:///modules/sshd/sshd_config',\r\n      notify => Service['sshd'],\r\n    }\r\n     service { 'sshd':\r\n      ensure    => running,\r\n      enable    => true,\r\n      subscribe => File['/etc/ssh/sshd_config'],\r\n    }\r\nChaining Arrows\r\n\r\n    # ntp.conf is applied first, and will notify the ntpd service if it changes:\r\n    File['/etc/ntp.conf'] ~> Service['ntpd']\r\nYou can create relationships between two resources or groups of resources using the -> and ~> operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n-> (ordering arrow)\r\nCauses the resource on the left to be applied before the resource on the right. Written with a hyphen and a greater-than sign.\r\n~> (notification arrow)\r\nCauses the resource on the left to be applied first, and sends a refresh event to the resource on the right if the left resource changes. Written with a tilde and a greater-than sign.\r\n\r\nNote: Arrays of references cannot be chained. To chain multiple resources at once, you must use a multi-resource reference or a collector.\r\nAn operand can be shared between two chaining statements, which allows you to link them together into a “timeline:”\r\n\r\n    Package['ntp'] -> File['/etc/ntp.conf'] ~> Service['ntpd']\r\n\t\r\n\tSince resource declarations can be chained, you can use chaining arrows to make Puppet apply a section of code in the order that it is written:\r\n\r\n    # first:\r\n    package { 'openssh-server':\r\n      ensure => present,\r\n    } -> # and then:\r\n    file { '/etc/ssh/sshd_config':\r\n      ensure => file,\r\n      mode   => 600,\r\n      source => 'puppet:///modules/sshd/sshd_config',\r\n    } ~> # and then:\r\n    service { 'sshd':\r\n      ensure => running,\r\n      enable => true,\r\n    }\r\n\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe require function declares a class and causes it to become a dependency of the surrounding container:\r\n\r\n    class wordpress {\r\n      require apache\r\n      require mysql\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\nThe above example would cause every resource in the apache and mysql classes to be applied before any of the resources in the wordpress class.\r\n\r\nUnlike the relationship metaparameters and chaining arrows, the require function does not have a reciprocal form or a notifying form. \r\nHowever, more complex behavior can be obtained by combining include and chaining arrows inside a class definition:\r\n\r\n    class apache::ssl {\r\n      include site::certificates\r\n      # Restart every service in this class if any of our SSL certificates change on disk:\r\n      Class['site::certificates'] ~> Class['apache::ssl']\r\n    }\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\nDefined resource types (also called defined types or defines) are blocks of Puppet code that can be evaluated multiple times with different parameters. \r\nOnce defined, they act like a new resource type: you can cause the block to be evaluated by declaring a resource of that new resource type.\r\n\r\nDefines can be used as simple macros or as a lightweight way to develop fairly sophisticated resource types.\r\n\r\nSyntax \r\n-------------\r\nDefining a Type\r\nYou can use a define statement to create a new defined resource type.\r\n\r\n# /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/apache/manifests/vhost.pp\r\n\r\ndefine apache::vhost (Integer $port, String[1] $docroot, String[1] $servername = $title, String $vhost_name = '*') {\r\n  include apache \t\t\t\t\t\t\t# contains Package['httpd'] and Service['httpd']\r\n  include apache::params \t\t\t\t\t# contains common config settings\r\n  $vhost_dir = $apache::params::vhost_dir\r\n  \r\n  file { \"${vhost_dir}/${servername}.conf\":\r\n    content => template('apache/vhost-default.conf.erb'),\r\n      # This template can access all of the parameters and variables from above.\r\n    owner   => 'www',\r\n    group   => 'www',\r\n\t\r\n    mode    => '644',\r\n    require => Package['httpd'],\r\n    notify  => Service['httpd'],\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n----  just a params example\r\n\t\t\t\t\t# /etc/puppet/modules/webserver/manifests/params.pp\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tclass webserver::params {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  $packages = $operatingsystem ? {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/(?i-mx:ubuntu|debian)/        => 'apache2',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/(?i-mx:centos|fedora|redhat)/ => 'httpd',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  }\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  $vhost_dir = $operatingsystem ? {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/(?i-mx:ubuntu|debian)/        => '/etc/apache2/sites-enabled',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/(?i-mx:centos|fedora|redhat)/ => '/etc/httpd/conf.d',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  }\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t# /etc/puppet/modules/webserver/manifests/init.pp\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tclass webserver(\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  String $packages  = $webserver::params::packages,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  String $vhost_dir = $webserver::params::vhost_dir\r\n\t\t\t\t\t) inherits webserver::params {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t package { $packages: ensure => present }\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t file { 'vhost_dir':\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   path   => $vhost_dir,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   ensure => directory,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   mode   => '0750',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   owner  => 'www-data',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   group  => 'root',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t }\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n----\r\nThis creates a new resource type called apache::vhost.\r\n\r\nThe general form of a define statement is:\r\n\r\nThe define keyword\r\nThe name of the defined type\r\nAn optional parameter list, which consists of:\r\nAn opening parenthesis\r\nA comma-separated list of parameters (e.g. String $myparam = \"default value\").

To execute the code, you must declare one or more resources of the defined type.\r\n\r\nDeclaring an Instance\r\n\r\nInstances of a defined type (often just called “resources”) can be declared the same way a normal resource is declared. (That is, with a resource type, title, and set of attribute/value pairs.)\r\n\r\nThe parameters used when defining the type become the attributes (without the $ prefix) used when declaring resources of that type. Parameters which have a default value are optional; if they are left out of the declaration, the default will be used. Parameters without defaults must be specified.\r\n\r\nTo declare a resource of the apache::vhost defined type from the example above:\r\n\r\napache::vhost {'homepages':\r\n  port    => 8081,\r\n  docroot => '/var/www-testhost',\r\n}\r\nBehavior\r\nIf a defined type is present and loadable (see “Location” below), you can declare resources of that defined type anywhere in your manifests.\r\n\r\nDeclaring a new resource of the defined type will make Puppet re-evaluate the block of code in the definition, using different values for the parameters.\r\n\r\nParameters and Attributes\r\n\r\nEvery parameter of a defined type can be used as a local variable inside the definition. These variables are not set with normal assignment statements; instead, each instance of the defined type uses its attributes to set them:\r\n\r\napache::vhost {'homepages':\r\n  port    => 8081, # Becomes the value of $port\r\n  docroot => '/var/www-testhost', # Becomes the value of $docroot\r\n}\r\nIn the define statement that creates the defined type, each parameter can be preceeded by an optional data type. If you include one, Puppet will check the parameter’s value at runtime to make sure that it has the right data type, and raise an error if the value is illegal. If no data type is provided, the parameter will accept values of any data type.\r\n\r\nNote that the special variables $title and $name are both set to the defined type’s name automatically, so they can’t be used as parameters.\r\n\r\n$title and $name\r\n\r\nEvery defined type gets two “free” parameters, which are always available and do not have to be explicitly added to the definition:\r\n\r\n$title is always set to the title of the instance. Since it is guaranteed to be unique for each instance, it is useful when making sure that contained resources are unique. (See “Resource Uniqueness” below.)\r\n$name defaults to the value of $title, but users can optionally specify a different value when they declare an instance.

As the default value is defined in params.pp,\r\nthe main apache class has to inherit it, as shown in the following code:\r\n\r\nclass apache (\r\n  $package_name = $apache::params::package_name,\r\n  ) inherits apache::params {\r\n    package { $apache::params::package_name:\r\n      ensure => present,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nThe params pattern has been widely used, and it works well. Still, it mixes code and data, even if this is done only in a dedicated subclass.\r\n====================\r\n\r\nclass postgresql […] { […]\r\nclass{'postgresql::install': } ->\r\nclass{'postgresql::config': } ~>\r\nclass{'postgresql::service': }\r\n}\r\n\r\nChaining Arrows\r\n\r\n    # ntp.conf is applied first, and will notify the ntpd service if it changes:\r\n    File['/etc/ntp.conf'] ~> Service['ntpd']\r\n\r\nAnchor Pattern\r\n-----\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.mayflower.de/4573-The-Puppet-Anchor-Pattern-in-Practice.html\r\nPuppet extends this dependency to the resources declared in that class, as we may expect, but not to other classes eventually\r\ndeclared (included) there.\r\n\r\nThis may create problems and lead to unexpected behaviors (dependencies not managed in the order expected) when referring to a \r\nclass such as postgresql, which we have seen, where the main class includes other subclasses.\r\nA widely used workaround is the anchor pattern defined by Puppet Lab's Jeff\r\nMcCune. It is based on the anchor type included in Puppet Labs' stdlib module.\r\nThe anchor type can be declared as a normal resource in the following way:\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::start': }\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::end': }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::start': } ->\r\nclass{'postgresql::install': } ->\r\nclass{'postgresql::config': } ~>\r\nclass{'postgresql::service': } ->\r\nanchor { 'postgresql::end': }\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this way, we can create a relationship that involves a whole class with a chaining\r\narrow as follows:\r\n\r\nclass { 'postgresql': } -> class { 'wordpress': }\r\nBy doing so, we are sure that all the resources provided in the postgresql class\r\nare applied before the wordpress class' declarations, because they are explicitly\r\ncontained in the anchor resource type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=============================\r\nDefined resource types (also called defined types or defines) are blocks of Puppet code that can be evaluated multiple times with different parameters. Once defined, they act like a new resource type: you can cause the block to be evaluated by declaring a resource of that new resource type.\r\n\r\nDefines can be used as simple macros or as a lightweight way to develop fairly sophisticated resource types.\r\n\r\nSyntax\r\nDefining a Type\r\n\r\nYou can use a define statement to create a new defined resource type.\r\n\r\n# /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/apache/manifests/vhost.pp\r\n\r\ndefine apache::vhost (\r\n  Integer $port,\r\n  String[1] $docroot,\r\n  String[1] $servername = $title,\r\n  String $vhost_name = '*'\r\n  ) {\r\n  include apache \t\t\t\t\t\t\t# contains Package['httpd'] and Service['httpd']\r\n  include apache::params \t\t\t\t\t# contains common config settings\r\n  $vhost_dir = $apache::params::vhost_dir\r\n  file { \"${vhost_dir}/${servername}.conf\":\r\n    content => template('apache/vhost-default.conf.erb'),\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t# This template can access all of the parameters and variables from above.\r\n    owner   => 'www',\r\n    group   => 'www',\r\n    mode    => '644',\r\n    require => Package['httpd'],\r\n    notify  => Service['httpd'],\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis creates a new resource type called apache::vhost.\r\n\r\nThe general form of a define statement is:\r\n\r\n\t\tThe define keyword\r\n\t\tThe name of the defined type\r\n\t\tAn optional parameter list, which consists of:\r\n\t\tAn opening parenthesis\r\n\t\tA comma-separated list of parameters (e.g. String $myparam = \"default value\"). Each parameter consists of:\r\n\t\tAn optional data type, which will restrict the allowed values for the parameter (defaults to Any)\r\n\t\tA variable name to represent the parameter, including the $ prefix\r\n\t\tAn optional equals (=) sign and default value (which must match the data type, if one was specified)\r\n\t\tAn optional trailing comma after the last parameter\r\n\t\tA closing parenthesis\r\n\t\tAn opening curly brace\r\n\t\tA block of arbitrary Puppet code, which generally contains at least one resource declaration\r\n\t\tA closing curly brace\r\n\t\tThe definition does not cause the code in the block to be added to the catalog; it only makes it available. To execute the code, you must declare one or more resources of the defined type.\r\n\r\nDeclaring an Instance\r\n\r\nInstances of a defined type (often just called “resources”) can be declared the same way a normal resource is declared.\r\n(That is, with a resource type, title, and set of attribute/value pairs.)\r\n\r\nThe parameters used when defining the type become the attributes (without the $ prefix) used when declaring resources of that type.\r\nParameters which have a default value are optional; if they are left out of the declaration, the default will be used. \r\nParameters without defaults must be specified.\r\n\r\nTo declare a resource of the apache::vhost defined type from the example above:\r\n\r\napache::vhost {'homepages':\r\n  port    => 8081,\r\n  docroot => '/var/www-testhost',\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n$title and $name\r\nEvery defined type gets two “free” parameters, which are always available and do not have to be explicitly added to the definition:\r\n\r\n$title is always set to the title of the instance. Since it is guaranteed to be unique for each instance, it is useful when making sure that \r\n     contained resources are unique. (See “Resource Uniqueness” below.)\r\n$name defaults to the value of $title, but users can optionally specify a different value when they declare an instance. \r\n     This is only useful for mimicking the behavior of a resource with a namevar, which is usually unnecessary. If you are wondering whether to use $name or $title, use $title.\r\n\t\r\nUnlike the other parameters, the values of $title and $name are already available inside the parameter list. This means you can use $title as the default value (or part of the default value) for another attribute:\r\n=========================================\r\nbefore\r\n\tCauses a resource to be applied before the target resource.\r\nrequire\r\n\tCauses a resource to be applied after the target resource.\r\nnotify\r\n\tCauses a resource to be applied before the target resource. The target resource will refresh if the notifying resource changes.\r\nsubscribe\r\n\tCauses a resource to be applied after the target resource. The subscribing resource will refresh if the target resource changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf two resources need to happen in order, you can either put a before attribute in the prior one or a require attribute in the subsequent one; either approach will create the same relationship. The same is true of notify and subscribe.\r\n\r\nThe two examples below create the same ordering relationship:\r\n\r\n    package { 'openssh-server':\r\n      ensure => present,\r\n      before => File['/etc/ssh/sshd_config'],\r\n    }\r\n     file { '/etc/ssh/sshd_config':\r\n      ensure  => file,\r\n      mode    => 600,\r\n      source  => 'puppet:///modules/sshd/sshd_config',\r\n      require => Package['openssh-server'],\r\n    }\r\nThe two examples below create the same notification relationship:\r\n\r\n    file { '/etc/ssh/sshd_config':\r\n      ensure => file,\r\n      mode   => 600,\r\n      source => 'puppet:///modules/sshd/sshd_config',\r\n      notify => Service['sshd'],\r\n    }\r\n     service { 'sshd':\r\n      ensure    => running,\r\n      enable    => true,\r\n      subscribe => File['/etc/ssh/sshd_config'],\r\n    }\r\nChaining Arrows\r\n\r\n    # ntp.conf is applied first, and will notify the ntpd service if it changes:\r\n    File['/etc/ntp.conf'] ~> Service['ntpd']\r\nYou can create relationships between two resources or groups of resources using the -> and ~> operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n-> (ordering arrow)\r\nCauses the resource on the left to be applied before the resource on the right. Written with a hyphen and a greater-than sign.\r\n~> (notification arrow)\r\nCauses the resource on the left to be applied first, and sends a refresh event to the resource on the right if the left resource changes. Written with a tilde and a greater-than sign.\r\n\r\nNote: Arrays of references cannot be chained. To chain multiple resources at once, you must use a multi-resource reference or a collector.\r\nAn operand can be shared between two chaining statements, which allows you to link them together into a “timeline:”\r\n\r\n    Package['ntp'] -> File['/etc/ntp.conf'] ~> Service['ntpd']\r\n\t\r\n\tSince resource declarations can be chained, you can use chaining arrows to make Puppet apply a section of code in the order that it is written:\r\n\r\n    # first:\r\n    package { 'openssh-server':\r\n      ensure => present,\r\n    } -> # and then:\r\n    file { '/etc/ssh/sshd_config':\r\n      ensure => file,\r\n      mode   => 600,\r\n      source => 'puppet:///modules/sshd/sshd_config',\r\n    } ~> # and then:\r\n    service { 'sshd':\r\n      ensure => running,\r\n      enable => true,\r\n    }\r\n\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe require function declares a class and causes it to become a dependency of the surrounding container:\r\n\r\n    class wordpress {\r\n      require apache\r\n      require mysql\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\nThe above example would cause every resource in the apache and mysql classes to be applied before any of the resources in the wordpress class.\r\n\r\nUnlike the relationship metaparameters and chaining arrows, the require function does not have a reciprocal form or a notifying form. \r\nHowever, more complex behavior can be obtained by combining include and chaining arrows inside a class definition:\r\n\r\n    class apache::ssl {\r\n      include site::certificates\r\n      # Restart every service in this class if any of our SSL certificates change on disk:\r\n      Class['site::certificates'] ~> Class['apache::ssl']\r\n    }\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\nDefined resource types (also called defined types or defines) are blocks of Puppet code that can be evaluated multiple times with different parameters. \r\nOnce defined, they act like a new resource type: you can cause the block to be evaluated by declaring a resource of that new resource type.\r\n\r\nDefines can be used as simple macros or as a lightweight way to develop fairly sophisticated resource types.\r\n\r\nSyntax \r\n-------------\r\nDefining a Type\r\nYou can use a define statement to create a new defined resource type.\r\n\r\n# /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/apache/manifests/vhost.pp\r\n\r\ndefine apache::vhost (Integer $port, String[1] $docroot, String[1] $servername = $title, String $vhost_name = '*') {\r\n  include apache \t\t\t\t\t\t\t# contains Package['httpd'] and Service['httpd']\r\n  include apache::params \t\t\t\t\t# contains common config settings\r\n  $vhost_dir = $apache::params::vhost_dir\r\n  \r\n  file { \"${vhost_dir}/${servername}.conf\":\r\n    content => template('apache/vhost-default.conf.erb'),\r\n      # This template can access all of the parameters and variables from above.\r\n    owner   => 'www',\r\n    group   => 'www',\r\n\t\r\n    mode    => '644',\r\n    require => Package['httpd'],\r\n    notify  => Service['httpd'],\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n----  just a params example\r\n\t\t\t\t\t# /etc/puppet/modules/webserver/manifests/params.pp\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tclass webserver::params {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  $packages = $operatingsystem ? {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/(?i-mx:ubuntu|debian)/        => 'apache2',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/(?i-mx:centos|fedora|redhat)/ => 'httpd',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  }\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  $vhost_dir = $operatingsystem ? {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/(?i-mx:ubuntu|debian)/        => '/etc/apache2/sites-enabled',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/(?i-mx:centos|fedora|redhat)/ => '/etc/httpd/conf.d',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  }\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t# /etc/puppet/modules/webserver/manifests/init.pp\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tclass webserver(\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  String $packages  = $webserver::params::packages,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  String $vhost_dir = $webserver::params::vhost_dir\r\n\t\t\t\t\t) inherits webserver::params {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t package { $packages: ensure => present }\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t file { 'vhost_dir':\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   path   => $vhost_dir,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   ensure => directory,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   mode   => '0750',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   owner  => 'www-data',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   group  => 'root',\r\n\t\t\t\t\t }\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n----\r\nThis creates a new resource type called apache::vhost.\r\n\r\nThe general form of a define statement is:\r\n\r\nThe define keyword\r\nThe name of the defined type\r\nAn optional parameter list, which consists of:\r\nAn opening parenthesis\r\nA comma-separated list of parameters (e.g. String $myparam = \"default value\").

To execute the code, you must declare one or more resources of the defined type.\r\n\r\nDeclaring an Instance\r\n\r\nInstances of a defined type (often just called “resources”) can be declared the same way a normal resource is declared. (That is, with a resource type, title, and set of attribute/value pairs.)\r\n\r\nThe parameters used when defining the type become the attributes (without the $ prefix) used when declaring resources of that type. Parameters which have a default value are optional; if they are left out of the declaration, the default will be used. Parameters without defaults must be specified.\r\n\r\nTo declare a resource of the apache::vhost defined type from the example above:\r\n\r\napache::vhost {'homepages':\r\n  port    => 8081,\r\n  docroot => '/var/www-testhost',\r\n}\r\nBehavior\r\nIf a defined type is present and loadable (see “Location” below), you can declare resources of that defined type anywhere in your manifests.\r\n\r\nDeclaring a new resource of the defined type will make Puppet re-evaluate the block of code in the definition, using different values for the parameters.\r\n\r\nParameters and Attributes\r\n\r\nEvery parameter of a defined type can be used as a local variable inside the definition. These variables are not set with normal assignment statements; instead, each instance of the defined type uses its attributes to set them:\r\n\r\napache::vhost {'homepages':\r\n  port    => 8081, # Becomes the value of $port\r\n  docroot => '/var/www-testhost', # Becomes the value of $docroot\r\n}\r\nIn the define statement that creates the defined type, each parameter can be preceeded by an optional data type. If you include one, Puppet will check the parameter’s value at runtime to make sure that it has the right data type, and raise an error if the value is illegal. If no data type is provided, the parameter will accept values of any data type.\r\n\r\nNote that the special variables $title and $name are both set to the defined type’s name automatically, so they can’t be used as parameters.\r\n\r\n$title and $name\r\n\r\nEvery defined type gets two “free” parameters, which are always available and do not have to be explicitly added to the definition:\r\n\r\n$title is always set to the title of the instance. Since it is guaranteed to be unique for each instance, it is useful when making sure that contained resources are unique. (See “Resource Uniqueness” below.)\r\n$name defaults to the value of $title, but users can optionally specify a different value when they declare an instance. This is only useful for mimicking the behavior of a resource with a namevar, which is usually unnecessary. If you are wondering whether to use $name or $title, use $title.\r\nUnlike the other parameters, the values of $title and $name are already available inside the parameter list.

It has a pretty awful runtime of ~9 minutes now.\r\n          I probably need to put password authentication on the final place this is hosted, as there are a number of passwords embedded in the perl code.\r\n        \r\n          "], ["updated_at", 2017-03-14 18:03:37 UTC], ["id", 36]]

This happened after I once adjusted the date/time in the BIOS. I already changed the mainboard but the situation did not change.\r\n          A: This is caused by the /etc/adjtime file which is used to adjust the system clock's drift if you don't use the NTP protocol for example to obtain the system date/time from a time server.\r\n        \r\n          Technical background: On systems with a reliable clock reference (such as the TSC register in Pentium-class CPUs) the difference between the elapsed time of the CPU and the system clock is saved into the /etc/adjtime file. This is used at the next reboot to adjust the system clock.\r\n        \r\n          If you manually change the system date/time in the BIOS you actually confuse this mechanism: A large drift value will be written into /etc/adjtime which will cause your system clock to become wrongly adjusted each time you reboot.\r\n        \r\n          Solution:\r\n        \r\n          Check if your system clock is kept in UTC (Universal Coordinated Time). On SuSE Linux for example, this is indicated with the GMT= variable in /etc/rc.config: If GMT=\"-u\" your system clock is kept in UTC.\r\n          Delete the /etc/adjtime file.\r\n          Use the date command to adjust the system's date/time (date MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss] - see man date).\r\n          Execute hwclock --systohc to write this adjusted date/time into the system clock (if your system clock is kept in UTC you should additionally specify the --utc option).\r\n          Alternatively, you can simply delete the /etc/adjtime file, shut-down your system and adjust the date/time in the BIOS (according to UTC or not, depending on your settings in /etc/rc.config)."], ["updated_at", 2017-03-21 15:25:18 UTC], ["id", 37]]
